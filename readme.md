<h2>Multimeter</h2>
<p>
This is my attempt at making a multimeter. It differs from standard multimeters in several
respects. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Only the most used modes are actually included: VDC, Ohms, (Capacitance)</li>
<li>Powered by a USB cable, no changing batteries.</li> 
<li>Generally a different user interface because of 1 and 2.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
Currently I am getting somewhat accurate readings of voltage and resistance. 
I have repurposed the first revision into just a voltmeter. There are problems
with the switching circuit that I have fixed in the second revision. 
</p>
<h3>Specs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Max Measurement Voltage: 60V</li>
<li>Max Measurement Resistance: 50kÎ©</li>
<li>
Accuracy
<ul>
<li> Voltage: 1% </li> 
<li> Resistance (100-40k): 10% </li>
<li> Capacitance: Order of Magnitude </li>
</ul>
</ul>
