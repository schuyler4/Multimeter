<h2>Multimeter</h2>
<p>
This is my homebrew multimeter. It differs from standard multimeters in several
respects. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Only the most used modes are actually included: VDC, Ohms, Capacitance</li>
<li>Powered by a USB cable, no changing batteries.</li> 
<li>Generally a different user interface because of 1 and 2.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Calibration</h3>
<p>
Calibration is relative to my Fluke 101 Multimeter. I know that there
is probably some technical problems with this, as the Fluke 101 does
not have more digits than this meter, nor is it substantially more
 accurate in
voltage mode. However, I don't have a really nice bench top meter, so it 
will have to do.
