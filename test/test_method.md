<h2> Multimeter Test Method </h2>
<p>
Before running the test, the multimeter is adjusted. Instead of calibrating it for real, it is calibrated
using another multimeter as a reference. This is done by measuring a 9V voltage source with the reference multimeter, and adjusting
the multimeter to match the reading of the reference multimeter. Because
the multimeter has nearly perfect zero error, this adjustment is a 
multiplier.
</p>
<h3> Voltage Mode Adjustment </h3>
Measure a voltage source with the meter and the reference meter. Because the meter has high voltage mode linearity, the value of this voltage
source should not matter as much as long as it is within the range that
the meter can measure (+/-60V). ~9V has been used previously.  
<p>
<h3> Calibration </h3>
Like with the adjustment, the calibration will just be a comparison to another multimeter. Voltage, Resistance, and Capacitance
are measured with the calibration meter and reference meter, and the 
percent error is calculated. The values to measure for all three
modes are listed below</p>
<h3> Calibration Values </h3>
<ul>
<li> Voltage: Adjustable Power Supply (-60V to 60V, 5V Steps + 1V and -1V)</li>
<li> Resistance Range 1: (30立, 100立, 1k立, 10k立, 22k, 100k, 330k) </li>
<li> Capacitor: (0.05uF, 0.1uF, 1uF, 10uF, 47uF) </li> 
</ul>
