<h2> Multimeter Test Method </h2>
<h3> Accuracy/Precision Test </h3>
<p>
Before running the test, the multimeter is calibrated/adjusted. Instead of calibrating it for real, it is calibrated
using another multimeter as a reference. This is done by measuring a 5V PSU with the reference multimeter, and adjusting
the multimeter to match the reading of the reference multimeter.
</p>
<p>
Like with the calibration, the testing will just be a comparison to another multimeter. Voltage, Resistance, and Capacitance
are measured with each multimeter, and the multimeter is compared to the reference multimeter. The measurement components are
listed below: 
</p>
<h3> Measurement Sources </h3>
<ul>
<li> Voltage Source: Adjustable Power Supply (0-60V, 5V Steps) 1V Calibration Value </li>
<li> Resistor: (0.1%) THT Resistors (10Ω, 100Ω, 1kΩ (Calibration Value), 10kΩ, 40kΩ) </li>
<li> Capacitor: (1%) THT Capacitors C0G (0.01uF, 0.1uF (Calibration Value), 1uF, 10uF) </li> 
</ul>
<h3> Preliminary Testing </h3>
<p>
Preliminary testing can be done with adjustable power supply and lower tolerance components. However, this obviously will
not be as accurate.
